This is a prototype using Python and PymNet library to simulate multilayer and multiplex networks.

The siumulation can be done using Spyder or PyCharm IDE. There is some issues with running PymNet on Jupyter notebooks.

The details of PymNet library and installation process can be found in: http://www.mkivela.com/pymnet/
